## this my (kermintor) personal tmux configurations.
## TODO:
- finally use some sort of a dotfile manager to manage my dotfiles.
- create a script to install all the required packages and configurations for my personal setup.
- finally unite the neovim and tmux repos into one repo.
- finally create ansible playbook to install all the required packages and configurations for my personal setup.

### For whom it may concern:

if your'e a beginner in tmux, you can use this configurations to get started with tmux.
these configurations are simple to understand and easy to use.
all they do is change tmux color schema to rose-pine (the best in the business) and change some key binding to make it more human friendly.
If your'e intersted in tmux you are probably intersted in vim as well, you can check out my neovim configuration file on a seperate repository.
I hope you find this configurations helpful and easy to use.
Feel free to contact me if you have any question regarding these configurations.
